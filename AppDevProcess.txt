First of all, making this app was a challenge to me as i was not that good in using javafx,
But that's a lame excuse because i am a programmer i've got my buddies (Google and StackOverflow)
I started programming because i wanted to be a mobile dev, i had to learn javafx because my system can't run
Android studio and i was very desperate to start making apps.

PROBLEMS I FACED AND HOW I SOLVED THEM:

1. The first problem i faced was how to make the database connection info not to be hard coded. I copied a
Database connection class from stackoverflow that had to be hard-coded, but after a lot of researching
i found out about singleton classes and i used the concept to modify my Database connector class

2. Another issue i faced was how to share current user instance among my classes, Singleton model came to
the rescue again. (check LOGINCONTROLLER)

3. The last issue i faced that made me left this project for almost two months was how to get all my previous
todos to appear on my ALLSLICES page into a listview.. I later realized i couldn't do it and shouldn't force
myself since im not a javafx developer but a mobile app developer, So i solved it by searching through all the
slices in the database and adding it to my ALLSLICES page as a string file.
